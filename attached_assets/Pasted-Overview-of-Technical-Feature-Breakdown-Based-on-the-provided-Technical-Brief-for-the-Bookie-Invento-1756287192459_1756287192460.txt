Overview of Technical Feature Breakdown
Based on the provided Technical Brief for the Bookie Inventory Management System, I've broken down the core and additional features into detailed technical points. For each feature, I've outlined:

Sub-features/Processes: Key functionalities within the feature.
Forms/Screens: User interfaces (applicable to both web and mobile apps) where interactions occur.
Fields: Input elements in forms, including data types.
Validations: Rules to ensure data integrity, including required fields, format checks, and business logic.

This breakdown assumes a full-stack implementation with React.js (web), React Native (mobile), Node.js/Express backend, and MySQL/PostgreSQL database. Features like automated calculations and WhatsApp integration will involve backend cron jobs, API endpoints, and integrations (e.g., WhatsApp Business API). Real-time updates can use WebSockets or polling.

1. Uplink & Downline Management
This feature handles creating and managing profiles for uplinks (inventory suppliers) and downlines (inventory recipients). Profiles store contact, rate, and commission details for use in transactions and calculations.
Sub-features/Processes:

Create, edit, view, and delete profiles.
Search/filter profiles by name, contact, or type (uplink/downline).
Assign unique IDs to profiles for referencing in transactions.

Forms/Screens:

Profile Creation/Edit Form: A modal or full-screen form for adding/updating uplink or downline details.
Profile List Screen: A dashboard table view with search, sort, and pagination.
Profile Detail View: Read-only screen showing full profile info with edit/delete buttons.

Fields (in Profile Creation/Edit Form):

Type: Dropdown (options: Uplink, Downline). Data type: String (enum).
Name: Text input. Data type: String (max 100 chars).
Contact Info (Phone): Text input (for WhatsApp integration). Data type: String (phone number format).
Email: Text input. Data type: String (optional).
Rate per Point: Numeric input. Data type: Decimal (e.g., 1.5).
Commission Percentage: Numeric input. Data type: Decimal (e.g., 5.0, for downlines).
Notes: Textarea. Data type: String (optional, max 500 chars).

Validations:

Type: Required; must be either "Uplink" or "Downline".
Name: Required; min length 3 chars; no special characters except spaces/hyphens.
Contact Info (Phone): Required; valid international phone format (e.g., +91xxxxxxxxxx); check for duplicates in database.
Email: Optional; if provided, valid email format (regex: ^[\w-.]+@([\w-]+.)+[\w-]{2,4}$).
Rate per Point: Required for uplinks; positive number; min 0.01, max 1000 (business rule to prevent unrealistic rates).
Commission Percentage: Required for downlines; between 0 and 100; decimal allowed up to 2 places.
Notes: Optional; no validation beyond length.
Form-level: Ensure no duplicate profiles by name/phone; backend unique constraint on phone.


2. Inventory Transaction Management
This feature manages recording of inventory taken from uplinks and given to downlines, including points, rates, and commissions.
Sub-features/Processes:

Add new transactions (Inventory Taken or Given).
View transaction history with filters (date, uplink/downline, type).
Edit/delete transactions (with audit logging).
Real-time update of balances post-transaction.

Forms/Screens:

Transaction Creation Form: Form for logging a new transaction.
Transaction List Screen: Table view with filters (date range, type, profile), search, and export options.
Transaction Detail View: Shows full details with edit/delete options.

Fields (in Transaction Creation Form):

Transaction Type: Dropdown (options: Inventory Taken from Uplink, Inventory Given to Downline). Data type: String (enum).
Profile: Autocomplete dropdown (searchable list of uplinks/downlines based on type). Data type: ID (foreign key).
Date: Date picker. Data type: Date (default: current date).
Points: Numeric input. Data type: Integer (e.g., 1000).
Rate per Point: Numeric input (pre-filled from profile if available). Data type: Decimal.
Commission Percentage: Numeric input (pre-filled for downlines). Data type: Decimal (applicable only for "Given" type).
Notes: Textarea. Data type: String (optional).

Validations:

Transaction Type: Required; restricts profile dropdown (e.g., only uplinks for "Taken").
Profile: Required; must match type (uplink for Taken, downline for Given); validate existence in database.
Date: Required; must be past or current date (no future dates); format YYYY-MM-DD.
Points: Required; positive integer; min 1, max 1,000,000 (to prevent overflow in calculations).
Rate per Point: Required; positive decimal; min 0.01; if pre-filled, allow override but warn if different from profile.
Commission Percentage: Required for "Given" type; between 0 and 100; pre-filled validation as above.
Notes: Optional; max 500 chars.
Form-level: Calculate total value (points * rate * (1 + commission/100)) on submit; ensure it doesn't exceed bookie's available inventory (business rule check via backend query).


3. Automated Ledger Calculation
This feature automates weekly balance calculations, applying rates and commissions, and generates profit/loss reports.
Sub-features/Processes:

Backend cron job for weekly calculations (e.g., every Monday).
On-demand calculation via UI button.
Compute balances: Uplink (owed = sum(taken points * rate)), Downline (receivable = sum(given points * rate * (1 + commission/100))).
Bookie profit = total receivable - total owed.
Store calculated ledgers in database for history.

Forms/Screens:

Ledger Calculation Screen: Button to trigger manual calculation; displays results in a table.
Profit/Loss Report Screen: View with charts/tables for bookie overview.

Fields (Minimal, as this is mostly automated; fields in Report Filters):

Date Range Start: Date picker. Data type: Date.
Date Range End: Date picker. Data type: Date.
Profile Filter: Multi-select dropdown (uplinks/downlines). Data type: Array of IDs.

Validations:

Date Range Start: Required for custom reports; must be before End; valid date format.
Date Range End: Required; must be after Start; not future date.
Profile Filter: Optional; if selected, validate IDs exist.
Form-level: For automated runs, use fixed weekly range (e.g., previous Monday to Sunday); ensure no overlapping calculations (lock mechanism in backend).


4. Automatic Settlement & WhatsApp Integration
This feature generates and sends ledger balances weekly via WhatsApp, with manual trigger option.
Sub-features/Processes:

Auto-generate settlements on Mondays (cron job).
Format message: "Ledger Balance: [Amount] for [Period]".

Profiles to Settle: Required; at least one; validate phone numbers exist and are valid for WhatsApp.
Message Template: Required; min length 10 chars; include placeholders like {balance}, {period}.
