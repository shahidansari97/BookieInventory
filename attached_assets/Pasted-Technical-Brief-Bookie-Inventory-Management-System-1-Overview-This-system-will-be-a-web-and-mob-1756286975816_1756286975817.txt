Technical Brief – Bookie Inventory Management System
1. Overview
This system will be a web and mobile application designed to automate the management of inventory
(e.g., Cricket IDs, Super Masters) for bookies.
Currently, bookies take inventory from uplinks (exchanges) and distribute it to their downlines after
taking a commission percentage. The process is done manually in Excel and settled weekly via
WhatsApp messages.
The goal is to digitize this process, automate settlement calculations, and automatically send ledger
balances via WhatsApp.
Target Platforms:
● Web App – React.js preferred.
● Mobile App – React Native preferred.
● Backend – Node.js / Express with MySQL/PostgreSQL.
2. Current Workflow (Manual)
1. Bookie takes inventory points from uplinks with a rate.
2. Bookie distributes inventory to downlines with their own commission rate.
3. Transactions are recorded manually in Excel.
4. Every Monday, bookie tallies all uplink and downline balances.
5. Ledger balances are shared manually via WhatsApp.
3. Objectives
● Replace Excel-based tracking with a centralized digital ledger system.
● Automate balance calculations for uplinks and downlines.
● Provide real-time visibility of inventory points, rates, and balances.
● Automatically send weekly settlement reports via WhatsApp.
